# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.

# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
# Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
